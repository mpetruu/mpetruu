            <p>Since Emily is in a lower tax bracket now and expects her income to increase in the future, using a TFSA makes more sense. She won't get a big immediate tax break from an RRSP at her current income level, and withdrawals from a TFSA are tax-free later.</p>
            <h4>Why the Other Options Are Less Ideal:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>A. RRSP: Contributing to an RRSP in a low tax bracket provides a smaller tax deduction. She might benefit more from deferring those RRSP contributions until her income is higher, so the tax deduction is more valuable.</li>
              <li>C. High-Interest Savings Account (HISA): While safe and relatively liquid, the interest earned is taxable in a non-registered account, and rates may be lower than potential investment returns in a TFSA.</li>
              <li>D. Non-Registered Brokerage Account: Investment growth would be taxable every year (for dividends, interest) or upon sale (capital gains), which is less efficient than the tax-free growth of a TFSA.</li>

            <h3>Correct Answer!</h3>
            <p>A TFSA is flexible; any gains you earn are tax-free, and withdrawals will not trigger taxation or affect future contribution room if you re-contribute in subsequent years. For a 3-year time horizon, a conservative investment or a high-interest TFSA can help James protect his savings while still earning some growth.</p>
            <h4>Why the Other Options Are Less Ideal:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>B. RRSP + Home Buyers' Plan: While the HBP allows withdrawing up to $35,000 for a first home without immediate tax consequences, James must repay it over 15 years. If he doesn't, the withdrawn amount is added to his taxable income. Also, an RRSP is typically for longer-term retirement saving; it might be less flexible if timelines or plans change.</li>
              <li>C. Chequing Account: This offers no meaningful interest, so inflation erodes the value of the money over time.</li>
              <li>D. High-Risk Stocks: For a short 3-year goal, high volatility could mean James might face significant losses if the market dips at the wrong time.</li>

            <p>High-interest credit card debt is extremely costly. Paying it off first is almost always the best strategy because you effectively earn a "return" equal to the avoided 19% interest. After eliminating high-interest debt, Mia can direct future savings toward investments.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>B. TFSA while making minimum payments: The 19% interest on the card is far higher than typical TFSA investment returns, so Mia would be losing money by not paying down the card.</li>
              <li>C. Splitting the bonus: While it's better than not paying the card at all, carrying any high-interest debt still costs a lot. Paying it off completely first saves more money in the long run.</li>
              <li>D. GIC + minimum payments: A GIC might offer ~1‚Äì5% interest (depending on the market), which pales in comparison to 19% credit card interest costs.</li>

            <p>An emergency fund of 3‚Äì6 months of expenses provides a financial safety net if Daniel faces unexpected costs or job loss. A high-interest savings account ensures the funds remain accessible and preserve purchasing power better than a regular chequing account.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>B. Canadian Equity ETF: While investing for growth is important, going "all in" on equities before establishing an emergency fund is risky. A job loss or large expense could force him to sell at a bad time.</li>
              <li>C. Crypto Assets + TFSA: Crypto can be highly volatile and not suitable as a first move before having stable savings.</li>
              <li>D. Individual Stocks: Concentrated investments without a safety net can be too high-risk, especially if Daniel needs cash in an emergency.</li>

            <p>An RESP allows contributions to grow tax-free and makes Aisha eligible for the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG).
